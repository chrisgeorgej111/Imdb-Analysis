**Problem Statement **
The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects. Consider this as an open ended question and come up with more analysis points. 

This dataset has been preprocessed in cutting down the non-significant features,Handling missing values..

This dataset has been toned down to features like Director Name, gross, budget, duration, number of user voters, number of critic reviews, content rating and so on...

First of all There is no considerable correlation between the features and the target (Imdb).

Average Duration has the maximum imdb..The movies with largest and shortest duration have mixed imdb in the moderate range.

One particular genere and content rating  have highest imdb.

so from the above analysis one can say that imdb depends has a strong relationship with certain factors..
